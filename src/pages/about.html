    <p class="writing">
        Hello, I'm Julian, an aspiring web developer that's willing to <br>
        learn and develop my craft repeatedly and eventually branch out <br>
        to other field of software development. <br>
        <br></br>
        I'm someone who pays a lot of attention to the details of life. <br>
        I'm very philosophical about our existence and how we live. <br>
        Purpose and direction is incredibly important to me. <br>
        I have a natural atpitude and love for mathematics. <br>
        Programming has the same specificity and detail that in <br>
        many ways encompasses my persona as a whole. <br>
